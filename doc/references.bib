@article{Kaupuzs2017,
	abstract = {Corrections to scaling in the 3D Ising model are studied based on non-perturbative analytical arguments and Monte Carlo (MC) simulation data for different lattice sizes L. Analytical arguments show the existence of corrections with the exponent (gamma-1)/nu (approximately 0.38), the leading correction-to-scaling exponent being omega ={\textless} (gamma-1)/nu. A numerical estimation of omega from the susceptibility data within 40 ={\textless} L ={\textless} 2048 yields omega=0.25(33). It is consistent with the statement omega ={\textless} (gamma-1)/nu, as well as with the value omega = 1/8 of the GFD theory. We reconsider the MC estimation of omega from smaller lattice sizes to show that it does not lead to conclusive results, since the obtained values of omega depend on the particular method chosen. In particular, estimates ranging from omega =1.274(72) to omega=0.18(37) are obtained by four different finite-size scaling methods, using MC data for thermodynamic average quantities, as well as for partition function zeros. We discuss the influence of omega on the estimation of exponents eta and nu.},

We demonstrate its efficiency in the two-dimensional O(n) $\sigma$ models for n=1 (Ising) and n=2 (x-y) at their critical temperatures, and for n=3 (Heisenberg) with correlation lengths around 10 and 20. On lattices up to 1282 no sign of critical slowing down is visible with autocorrelation times of 1-2 steps per spin for estimators of long-range quantities.},

abstract = {The pseudo-$\epsilon$ expansions ($\tau$-series) for critical exponents of the three-dimensional XY model describing $\lambda$-transition in liquid helium are derived up to the$\tau$6terms. Numerical estimates extracted from the $\tau$-series obtained using the Pad{\'{e}}-Borel resummation technique, scaling relations and the seven-loop ($\tau$7) estimate for the Fisher exponent $\eta$ are presented including those for the exponents $\alpha$ and $\nu$ measured in experiments with a record accuracy. For the exponent $\alpha$ the procedure argued to be most reliable gives $\alpha$=-0.0117, the number that is very close to the most accurate experimental values. It signals that the pseudo-$\epsilon$ expansion approach is a powerful tool robust enough to evaluate critical exponents with small absolute errors. The arguments in favor of such a robustness are presented.},

The prescriptions can be applied to both unitary and non unitary theories allowing for the study of the spectrum of low-lying primary operators of the theory. We evaluate the lowest scaling dimensions of the local operators associated with the Yang-Lee edge singularity for {\$}2 \backslashle D \backslashle 6{\$}. Likewise we obtain the scaling dimensions of six scalars and four spinning operators for the 3d critical Ising model. Our findings are in agreement with existing results to a per mill precision and estimate several new exponents.},

  abstract = {A parallel [open multiprocessing (OpenMP)] implementation of the Wolff single-cluster algorithm has been developed and tested for the three-dimensional (3D) Ising model. The developed procedure is generalizable to other lattice spin models and its effectiveness depends on the specific application at hand. The applicability of the developed methodology is discussed in the context of the applications, where a sophisticated shuffling scheme is used to generate pseudorandom numbers of high quality, and an iterative method is applied to find the critical temperature of the 3D Ising model with a great accuracy. For the lattice with linear size L=1024, we have reached the speedup about 1.79 times on two processors and about 2.67 times on four processors, as compared to the serial code. According to our estimation, the speedup about three times on four processors is reachable for the O(n) models with n≥2. Furthermore, the application of the developed OpenMP code allows us to simulate larger lattices due to greater operative (shared) memory available.},
