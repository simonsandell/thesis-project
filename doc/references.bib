    abstract = {It is shown from first principles that, in spite of the large interatomic forces, liquid He should exhibit a transition analogous to the transition in an ideal Bose-Einstein gas. The exact partition function is written as an integral over trajectories, using the space-time approach to quantum mechanics. It is next argued that the motion of one atom through the others. is not opposed by a potential barrier because the others may move out of the way. This just increases the effective inertia of the moving atom. This permits a simpler form to be written for the partition function. A rough analysis of this form shows the existence of a transition, but of the third order. It is possible that a more complete analysis would show that the transition implied by the simplified partition function is actually like the experimental one.},

@article{Fisher1973,
    abstract = {The ordered state of a d-dimensional isotropic system with an n-vector (n≥2) order parameter is considered. By the imposition of suitable boundary conditions it is shown how to define explicitly a helicity modulus ϒ(T) which measures the free-energy increment associated with "twisting" the direction of the order parameter. For a Bose system the superfluid density is seen to be $\rho$s(T)=(m/ℏ)2ϒ(T). A critical exponent v is defined by ϒ(T)∼|T-Tc|v as T→Tc; for an ideal Bose gas and spherical model (n→∞), v=1 is an exact result for all d{\textgreater}2. The difficulties of defining a correlation length in the ordered phase are discussed. A full scaling theory of the correlations avoids these problems and may be linked to a phenomenological hydrodynamic approach, to clarify and rederive Josephson's relation v=2$\beta$-$\eta$$\nu$=2-$\alpha$-2$\nu$. This reduces to v=(d-2)$\nu$ (used by some authors with d=3), only if one accepts d-dependent, "hyperscaling" relations such as d$\nu$=2-$\alpha$; however, both these latter relations fail for the ideal Bose gas when d{\textgreater}4. An alternative derivation of the formula v=2-$\alpha$-2$\nu$ is based on the scaling theory for systems with a large but finite dimension.},

    abstract = {A new algorithm called Mersenne Twister (MT) is proposed for generating uniform pseudoran- dom numbers. For a particular choice of parameters, the algorithm provides a super astronom- ical period of 219937  1 and 623-dimensional equidistribution up to 32-bit accuracy, while using a working area of only 624 words. This is a new variant of the previously proposed generators, TGFSR, modified so as to admit a Mersenne-prime period. The characteristic polynomial has many terms. The distribution up to v bits accuracy for 1  v  32 is also shown to be good. An algorithm is also given that checks the primitivity of the characteristic polynomial of MT with computational complexity O( p2) where p is the degree of the polynomial. We implemented this generator in portable C-code. It passed several stringent statistical tests, including diehard. Its speed is comparable to other modern generators. Its merits are due to the efficient algorithms that are unique to polynomial calculations over the two-element field.},

We observe a discrepancy with the most recent experimental estimate of alpha; this discrepancy calls for further theoretical and experimental investigations. Our results are obtained by combining Monte Carlo simulations based on finite-size scaling methods, and high-temperature expansions. Two improved models (with suppressed leading scaling corrections) are selected by Monte Carlo computation. The critical exponents are computed from high-temperature expansions specialized to these improved models. By the same technique we determine the coefficients of the small-magnetization expansion of the equation of state. This expansion is extended analytically by means of approximate parametric representations, obtaining the equation of state in the whole critical region. We also determine the specific-heat amplitude ratio.},

    abstract = {We report the details and revised analysis of an experiment to measure the specific heat of helium with subnanokelvin temperature resolution near the lambda point. The measurements were made at the vapor pressure spanning the region from 22 mK below the superfluid transition to 4 uK above. The experiment was performed in earth orbit to reduce the rounding of the transition caused by gravitationally induced pressure gradients on earth. Specific heat measurements were made deep in the asymptotic region to within 2 nK of the transition. No evidence of rounding was found to this resolution. The optimum value of the critical exponent describing the specific heat singularity was found to be a = -0.0127+ - 0.0003. This is bracketed by two recent estimates based on renormalization group techniques, but is slightly outside the range of the error of the most recent result. The ratio of the coefficients of the leading order singularity on the two sides of the transition is A+/A- =1.053+ - 0.002, which agrees well with a recent estimate. By combining the specific heat and superfluid density exponents a test of the Josephson scaling relation can be made. Excellent agreement is found based on high precision measurements of the superfluid density made elsewhere. These results represent the most precise tests of theoretical predictions for critical phenomena to date.},

The applicability of the developed methodology is discussed in the context of the applications, where a sophisticated shuffling scheme is used to generate pseudorandom numbers of high quality, and an iterative method is applied to find the critical temperature of the 3D Ising model with a great accuracy. For the lattice with linear size L=1024, we have reached the speedup about 1.79 times on two processors and about 2.67 times on four processors, as compared to the serial code. According to our estimation, the speedup about three times on four processors is reachable for the O(n) models with n≥2. Furthermore, the application of the developed OpenMP code allows us to simulate larger lattices due to greater operative (shared) memory available.},

We reconsider the MC estimation of omega from smaller lattice sizes to show that it does not lead to conclusive results, since the obtained values of omega depend on the particular method chosen. In particular, estimates ranging from omega =1.274(72) to omega=0.18(37) are obtained by four different finite-size scaling methods, using MC data for thermodynamic average quantities, as well as for partition function zeros.
