% TODO: Scaling and universality: more equations.
% scaling laws and definitions of critical exponents, maybe remove? maybe write some text. move to appendix or other place?
% There should be some parts about xy model and ising3d model here.
In this section we will describe the models we simulate using Monte Carlo, as well as establish some theoretical background to explain how physical information can be extracted from simulated systems with sizes $10^X$ times smaller than actual realizations of the transition studied in experiments.
\section{Models} % define equations, define quantities.
The goal of this thesis is to estimate the critical exponents of the lambda phase transition (\lpt) in $^4$He by Monte Carlo (MC) simulation of a model. 
The principle of Universality allows us to freely chose a model for our simulation as long as it is part of the same Universality Class as the \lpt, since all those models are guaranteed to have the exact same critical properties. 
The three criteria that define universality classes are the symmetry group of the order parameter, the physical dimensions and the range of the interactions.
The class of the lamba transition in $^4$He is represented by the symmetry group $O(2)$, short range interactions and $d=3$. With $d=2$ instead the class changes to that of the famous topological Kosterlitz-Thouless transition.

The model we use in our simulation is the so-called XY-model in 3 dimension and allowing only nearest neighbour interactions on a cubic lattice.
We employ periodic boundary conditions, so that the nearest neighbours of any given lattice site $\bm{s} = (x,y,z)$ is defined as 
\begin{align}
    \bm{n_{1,2}} &= (\trm{mod}(L+x\pm1), &   &y,                    &    z)&\\
    \bm{n_{3,4}} &= (x,                  &   &\trm{mod}(L+y\pm1),   &    z)&\\
    \bm{n_{5,6}} &= (x,                  &   &y,                    &    \trm{mod}(L+z\pm1))&
\end{align}
where the lattice indices $(x,y,z)$ range from $[0,L-1]$.

The hamiltonian is written as 
\begin{equation}
  \label{xyham}
  H_{\trm{3DXY}} = -K\sum\limits_{\langle i,j\rangle} \bm{s_i}\cdot\bm{s_j} = -K\sum\limits_{\langle i,j\rangle} \cos(\alpha_i - \alpha_j)
\end{equation}
where $K$ is the coupling constant, which we during the rest of the thesis let $K=1$.
In the XY-model, the spins are confined to a plane, so they can be parametrized by $ \bm{s_1} = (\cos(\alpha_i),\sin(\alpha_i)$, hence the second equality in \ref{xyham}.

Next, we define some of the quantities which we calculate during simulation.
We define the magnetization as 
\begin{equation}
  M = \left| \sum_i \bm{s_i}\right|
  \label{}
\end{equation},
the energy as 
\begin{equation}
  E = -\sum\limits_{\langle i,j \rangle} \cos(\alpha_i - \alpha_j)
  \label{}
\end{equation},
the superfluid stiffness/helicity modulus as 
\begin{equation}
  L\rho_s = -\langle E\rangle - \frac{1}{T}\left\langle\left(\sum_i \sin(\alpha_i - \alpha_{i+(1,0,0)})\right)^2\right\rangle
  \label{}
\end{equation}
The superfluid stiffness/density/helicity modulus is a quantity representing the shift in free energy introduced by a twist of the spins.
To improve statistical results, we also compute
\begin{align}
  L\rho_s = -\langle E\rangle - \frac{1}{T}\left\langle\left(\sum_i \sin(\alpha_i - \alpha_{i+(0,1,0)})\right)^2\right\rangle\\
  L\rho_s = -\langle E\rangle - \frac{1}{T}\left\langle\left(\sum_i \sin(\alpha_i - \alpha_{i+(0,0,1)})\right)^2\right\rangle
  \label{}
\end{align}
In the regular liquid phase, the energy of the system is unaffected by uniform boundary motion. The superfluid stiffness is a quantity which measures the shift in energy due to a shift of the angles along a boundary.
It is interesting as it scales as 

The helicity modulus $\Upsilon(T)$ is a measure of the system to a ``phase twisting'' field, for a superfluid system the helicity modulus is related to the superfluid density
$\rho_s = (m/\hbar)^2 \Upsilon(T)$.
Fischer et al showed in 1973 that this quantity can be calculated within the framework of equilibrium statistical mechanics, but one need to go beyond bulk properties.
Operational definition for spherical model (1952 Barber Fischer) and ideal Bose gas (Barber 1977) under periodic and antiperiodic boundary conditions:
\begin{equation}
  \Upsilon(T) = \trm{lim}\limits_{L\rightarrow \infty} (2L^2/\pi^2) (F^{1/2} (T;L)-F^0(T;L)).
  \label{}
\end{equation}
Rudnick Jasnow (1977) operational definition: 
\begin{equation}
  \Upsilon(T) =\left \frac{  \pa^2F(T;k_0)}{\pa k^2_0}\right|_{k_0 =0}
  \label{}
\end{equation}
Thought: the boundary conditions induce a long wavelength twist of the wavenumber $k_0$ of the order parameter.
Showed that Josephson relation ($\nu = 2\beta -\eta\nu = 2 - \alpha -2\nu = (d -2)\nu$) (1966) is exact using this definition and epsilon-expansion.

\section{Scaling}
Often in physics, relations between different quantities are described by so-called power-laws, expressions on the form $f = f(\xi)\cdot g^{x}$, where the physical quantity $f$ is said to scale with $x$ in relation to some other physical quantity $g$. $\xi$ represents variables that are deemed irrelevant for the scaling behaviour of $f$.

So also in statistical physics, where such laws are fundamental to understanding phase transitions.

In statistical physics, when studying a specific system, the fundamental quantity is some thermodynamic potential,  Gibbs, Helmholtz. From this potential, several other physical quantites are derived, such as the energy, magnetization, and other that may depend on the specifics. 
If the system has a phase transition, often, but not always, since what constitutes a phase transition is not trivial, physical quantites will diverege, and follow certain scaling laws as they do. 
Using mean field theory to calculate these laws gives always a fractional exponent in the laws, but experiments had shown evidence of non-fractional exponents. 
Kadanoff realized that a diverging correlation length implied that there was a relation between the lenght scale at which the order parameter was defined and the coupling constants of an effective Hamiltonian. Altough his block-spin approach does not enable one to compute the critical expoents, it was an important step.
The full theory of Renormalization Group was put forth by Wilson.
The core concept is the renormalization group transformations which takes a Hamiltonian and by some method/rule of coarse-graining clumps together short wave-length degrees of freedom, and defines a new effective hamiltonian describing the long-wavelength degrees of freedom with new coupling parameters for the new lenghtscale.
The name renormalization group is not entirely appropriate, since these transformations are in general complicated and non-linear, thus not always having inverses. But the transformations do have the associative property of groups. Rescaling the system by some length $l_1$ and then rescaling again by some other length $l_2$ should be equivalent to performing the rescaling in the other order.
But so far all we did was remove a finite number of degrees of freedom from out system, how can that explain the sigular behaviour at phase transitions? By repeating the transformations an infinite number of times, singular behaviour can be introduced.
The partition function is what we really want to compute to know everything about a physical system, but that task is most often simply unachievable. The renormalization transformation are also not easy to compute, but the transformation of the coupling constants can be approximated.

\section{Universality}
The theromodynamics of any model; the phase diagram, correlation functions, other quantites etc, may depend on the specific values of coupling parameters in the hamiltonian, symmetries, dimensionality, type of lattice, etc. 
But it turns out that the critical phenomena (phase transitions) only depend on three things, the symmetries of the hamiltonian, the dimensionality and the range of interations ( type of critical point ).

We can study the critical behaviour of say Helium-4, which we know is in the $O(2)$ universality class, by calculation themodynamical averages directly by using Monte-Carlo method on the simulated 3DXY-model, which should have the exact same critical exponents. 
One inconvenience is that one cannot simulate the infinite size 3DXY-model due to computer memory finite-ness, thus one simulates instead finite-size versions of the 3DXY-model. The theory of how finite size systems relate to the infinite size models is called finite size scaling. The normal power-laws aquire correction terms, which needs to be accounted for.


\section{Finite size scaling}
Consider a system with a set of coupling constants $[K]$ and linear finite size $L$. 
The singular part of the free energy scales as
\begin{equation}
  f_s([K],L^{-1}) = l^{-d}f_s([K],lL^{-1}).
  \label{}
\end{equation}
Close to a fixed point of the RG, we can write this equation in terms of right eigenvectors of the linearized RG-transform,
\begin{equation}
  f_s(t,h,K_3,\cdots,L^{-1}) = l^{-d}f_s(tl^{y_t},hl^{y_h},K_3 l^{y_3},\cdots,lL^{-1}).
  \label{}
\end{equation}
It is evident that the inverse size of the system is in fact a relevant eigenvector with eigenvalue $y_L = 1$, and only becomes irrelevant in the thermodynamic limit $L^{-1}\rightarrow 0$.
The models we study in this paper have the external field set to zero, if we let the scaling parameter $l = L$, we can write the scaling form of the free energy as
\begin{equation}
  f_s(t,L^{-1}) = L^{-d} F_f(t L^{1/\nu})
  \label{}
\end{equation}
where we used $\nu = 1/y_t$ and the scaling law $2 -\alpha = d\nu$.
$F_f(tL^{1/\nu})$ is the form function for the free energy.
From this equation we can derive the finite size scaling behaviour of any physical quantities by utilizing their relation to the free energy. 
For example, we can find the scaling form of the specific heat as
\begin{equation}
  c_V = \frac{\partial ^2 f_s}{\partial t^2} \sim L^{-d +2/\nu}F_{c}(tL^{1/\nu}) = L^{\alpha/\nu} F_{c}(tL^{1/\nu}).
  \label{}
\end{equation}
This form function will have a maximum at some shifted value of $T$, 
\begin{equation}
  T_c(L) = T_c +  a_0 L^{-1/\nu}.
  \label{}
\end{equation}
This kind of correction is necessary to go from quantities simulated on finite systems to the infinite lattice universal quantities.


Higher order corrections can be included as well.
Similarly for the susceptibility,
\begin{align}
  \chi = \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial h^2}
  \sim L^{-d +2y_h}F_{\chi}(tL^{1/\nu}) = L^{2-\eta}F_{\chi}(tL^{1/\nu})
  \label{}
\end{align}
where we used that $ 2(d-y_h) = d -2 +\eta$.
The magnetization goes as
\begin{equation}
  M = \frac{\partial f}{\partial h} \sim L^{-d + y_h} = L^{-\beta/\nu}
  \label{}
\end{equation}
The 4th order Binder cumulandt is in the thermodynamic limit constant at $T_c$, and thus scales as 
\begin{equation}
  B \sim a_B(1+L^{-\omega})
  \label{}
\end{equation}
with our ansatz.
The derivative of the 4th order Binder cumuland scales as
\begin{equation}
  \frac{\der B}{\der T}\sim L
  \label{}
\end{equation}

\section{Scaling laws}
\begin{align}
  y_t &= \frac{1}{\nu}\\
  y_h &= \frac{2-\eta +d}{2}\\
  \Delta &= y_h/y_t\\
	2 - \eta &= \frac{\gamma}{\nu} = d\frac{\delta -1}{\delta+1}\\
	\nu d &= 2-\alpha = 2\beta + \gamma = \beta(\delta+1) = \gamma\frac{\delta +1}{\delta -1}
\end{align}
\section{Definitions of critical exponents}
For $h=0$,
\begin{align}
  f &\sim l^{-d}f(tl^{y_t},hl^{y_h},K_3l^{y_3},\cdots,L^{-1}l)\\
  C &\sim t^{-\alpha}\\
  M &\sim (-t)^{\beta}\\
  \chi &\sim |t|^{-\gamma}\\
  \xi &\sim |t|^{-\nu}\\
\end{align}  
For $t =0$,
\begin{align}
  h &\sim m^{\delta}\\
  \langle m(r)m(0)\rangle &\sim r^{-d +2 -\eta}
  \label{}
\end{align}
